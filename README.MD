# ISE 3230 Laundry Schedule Optimization Project
### Group 16 Members: Roble Gure, Kayla Schmidt, Luke Zhang

## Description

This was a final project for ISE 3230 (Systems Modeling and Optimization for Analytics) at The Ohio State University. The project focuses on creating an optimal laundry schedule for students using a shared dorm laundry room. The optimal schedule allows students to do laundry as quickly as possible. The video presentation for this project is linked [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxed-xK_0vI).
